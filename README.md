# Real_Time_Clock

This is a Real Time Clock project based on Atmage 32 microcontroller. 
This project is just a simple real time clock implementation using the help of the Timer1 peripheral. 

Quick brief about project: 
-Timer1 issues an interrupt every 1 second that is updated for seconds, minutes, and hours.
-Keypad is used to add some functionality to the project like ( Setting the clock to a desired time in seconds, minutes and hours,Resetting the clock if setting it )
-LCD is used in this project to guide the user in how to use the clock.
